# Predicting Bounding Boxes

This is a Programming Assignment from the Advanced Computer Vision with Tensorflow.

The goal is to build a model to predict bounding boxes around images.  
- We use transfer learning on the Mobilnet V2 model available in Keras. 
- We will be using the [Caltech Birds - 2010](http://www.vision.caltech.edu/visipedia/CUB-200.html) dataset.
